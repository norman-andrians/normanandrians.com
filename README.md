# Project pending

Estimated project completion will be... longüôÉÔ∏è, but I'll try to make it fasterüî•Ô∏è.

The development process is still in design, after the rapid learning process is completed we will try to use newest technology for this project. So lemme cooküî•Ô∏èüî•Ô∏è.

> Note: As you know I am in the process of learning, in this period I am undergoing a process of self-taught learning in earnest, if you know even though I am 3 years self-taught my knowledge is not enough to really make large-scale projects. while in the past I have made many projects now I realize the mistakes that I have faced in the past therefore now I am trying to cover them up.

‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
